				<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
				<h3>Online content</h3>
				<p>We assume no responsibility for the up-to-dateness, correctness,
				completeness or quality of the information provided. Liability
				claims against the Research Museum Alexander Koenig, which refer
				to material or non-material nature, caused by use or disuse of
				the information presented or by the use of incorrect and incomplete
				information are excluded unless there is demonstrable intentional
				or grossly negligent behavior on part of the author. All offers
				are non-binding and without obligation. The Research Museum
				Alexander Koenig reserves the right to change, supplement, or
				delete parts of or the entire offer without separate announcement
				and or to temporarily or permanently terminate the publication.</p>

				<h3>References and Links</h3>
				<p>The Research Museum Alexander Koenig is not liable for direct
				or indirect references to external Internet pages ("links"),
				which reside outside the responsibility of the Research Museum
				Alexander Koenig. A liability obligation would only become effective
				in the case that the Research Museum Alexander Koenig has notice of
				the contents and it is technically possible and reasonable to prevent
				the use in case of illegal contents. Therefore, the Research Museum
				Alexander Koenig explicitly declares that when placing the link the
				corresponding linked pages contained no illegal content. The author
				has absolutely no influence on the current and future design and
				contents of the linked / connected pages. Therefore he dissociates
				himself hereby explicitly from all contents of all linked / connected
				pages which were modified after the link placement.
				This applies to all link set within the own Internet offer and references
				as well as for external entries in guest books, discussion forums,
				linked archives and mailing lists provided by the Research Museum
				Alexander Koenig. For illegal, incorrect or incomplete content
				and especially for damages resulting from the use or disuse of
				such information the provider of the page to which reference
				was made is solely liable, not the person who has linked to these pages.
				</p>

				<p>The Research Museum Alexander Koenig strives to respect the
				copyright of the graphics, sound documents, video sequences and
				texts used in all publications. In addition, the Research Museum
				Alexander Koenig endeavours to use self-provided graphics, sound
				documents, video sequences and texts or to resort to license-free
				graphics, sound documents, video sequences and texts. All

				<h3>Legal validity of this disclaimer of liability</h3>
				<p>This disclaimer of liability is to be regarded as part of the
				internet offer which you were referred from. If sections or individual
				terms of this statement do not, no longer or do not completely
				conform to the valid legal status, the content and validity of
